ðŸ”§**Patching Policy - Automated Patching and Reboot**

Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for automated patching and reboot procedures to ensure the timely installation of updates on workstations and servers. This policy aims to enhance system security, performance, and reliability.

Policy Statement: Automated patching will be implemented to apply updates to workstations and servers at 4pm every Wednesday. The primary reboot policy will be activated if system restarts are required after patch installation. This policy ensures that systems remain up-to-date and secure.

Policy Guidelines:

1. **Automated Patching**: a. Patching will be scheduled to take place at 4pm every Wednesday. b. The patching process will automatically install applicable updates on workstations and servers. c. Patch management tools will be utilized to facilitate automated patch deployment.
2. **Primary Reboot Policy**: a. The primary reboot policy will be activated when system restarts are required after patch installation. b. If a reboot is necessary, users will receive a message every 4 hours requesting a reboot. Users can postpone the reboot if necessary. c. After 8 hours, a warning message will be sent 10 minutes before an automatic reboot is initiated.
3. **Idle Workstation Reboot**: a. If no user is logged into a workstation, the primary reboot policy will automatically reboot the system. b. This ensures that systems are regularly restarted even if no user is actively using the workstation.
4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: a. Patching and reboot activities will be monitored to ensure proper execution. b. Regular reports will be generated to track the status of patching and reboot compliance.

Compliance: All workstations and servers within the organization are required to comply with this policy. Non-compliance may result in system vulnerabilities and inadequate performance.

Responsibilities:

1. IT administrators are responsible for implementing and maintaining the automated patching and reboot systems.
2. Users are responsible for acknowledging and complying with reboot requests when necessary.

Review and Revision: This policy will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure its continued effectiveness and alignment with industry best practices and technological advancements.

By adhering to this policy, the organization ensures the timely installation of critical updates, enhancing system security and performance. Automated patching and reboot procedures minimize the risk of vulnerabilities and improve the overall reliability of workstations and servers.ðŸ”§
