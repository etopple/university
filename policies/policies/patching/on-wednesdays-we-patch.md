# On Wednesdays, We Patch

As part of our commitment to a Culture of Security, we manage the patching of computers in the following manner.&#x20;

(note, your system may have a custom policy enabled. Ask your eTop technician or company contact if you have a question.)

After years of testing and research, we find that Wednesday at 4pm is a good time to install system patches and reboot if necessary while also allowing for minimal downtime.&#x20;

When patches are installed that require a restart of the machine, the following message appears:

If you select the "Reboot Now" button, the computer will restart and install updates.&#x20;

If you select the "Remind me in 240 minutes" button, the computer will notify you of an impending restart. You have 10 minutes to save your work, and the machine will restart to install updates.&#x20;
