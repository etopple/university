## Terminology Guide for a Culture of Cybersecurity

Introduction: Maintaining consistent terminology is essential when discussing cybersecurity topics in various communication channels such as podcasts, LinkedIn posts, and email marketing. This guide provides standardized definitions for common cybersecurity terms to ensure clarity and coherence in all our communications.

1. Cybersecurity: The practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. Cybersecurity includes a set of techniques, processes, and technologies designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
2. Culture of Cybersecurity: An organizational mindset that prioritizes the importance of security in every aspect of business operations, where all employees actively participate in implementing and maintaining secure practices to protect the organization's digital assets.
3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): A security measure that requires users to provide at least two forms of identification to access sensitive information or systems. MFA often includes a combination of something the user knows (e.g., password), something the user has (e.g., hardware token, mobile device), and something the user is (e.g., biometrics).
4. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): A security solution designed to monitor and protect endpoint devices, such as laptops, desktop computers, and mobile devices, by identifying and responding to potential threats in real-time.
5. Managed Detection and Response (MDR): A comprehensive cybersecurity service that combines advanced technology, human expertise, and continuous monitoring to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real-time, providing organizations with proactive protection and threat mitigation.
6. Security Awareness Training (SAT): A comprehensive educational program that aims to equip employees with the knowledge and skills necessary to recognize and respond to potential security threats, thus fostering a strong security culture within the organization.
7. Patching: The process of updating software and systems to fix security vulnerabilities, close gaps, and improve performance. Timely patching is crucial for maintaining a secure cybersecurity environment.
8. Backups: The process of creating copies of data and storing them in a separate location, allowing for recovery in the event of data loss due to system failures, cyberattacks, or other incidents.
9. Phishing: A type of social engineering attack in which cybercriminals use email, text messages, or other communication methods to deceive users into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information, or to install malware on their devices.
10. Ransomware: A type of malicious software (malware) that encrypts the victim's data and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware attacks can cause significant disruption and financial loss to organizations and individuals.
11. Data Breach: An incident in which unauthorized individuals gain access to sensitive and confidential information, potentially leading to identity theft, financial fraud, or damage to an organization's reputation.
12. Incident Response: A structured process for identifying, investigating, and mitigating security incidents to minimize their impact on an organization and its digital assets.
13. Vulnerability: A weakness in a system or software that can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.
14. Encryption: The process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption is used to protect sensitive information during storage and transmission.
15. Firewall: A security technology that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls help protect networks and devices from unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
16. Intrusion Detection System (IDS): A security solution that monitors network traffic or system activities for signs of potential security breaches or malicious activity.

By adhering to the definitions provided in this terminology guide, we can ensure a consistent and clear message across all communication channels related to cybersecurity and our commitment to fostering a strong security culture.
