# Important Notice on Password Security Practices

As part of our commitment to maintaining the highest level of security for your accounts and data, we've observed some risky password management practices that we would like to bring to your attention.

Risky Behaviors Observed:

* Storing Passwords in Unsecured Documents: Keeping passwords in plain text files like Excel spreadsheets can expose sensitive information if accessed by unauthorized individuals.
* Sharing Logins and Passwords: Sharing account credentials compromises your security and can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.
* Writing Down Passwords: Physical notes can be lost, stolen, or viewed by others, posing a significant security risk.
* Points of Contact Documenting Employees' Computer Passwords: Centralizing employee passwords with a single point of contact increases the risk of unauthorized access if that information is compromised.

We understand that some of these practices may offer short-term convenience, but they significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

Recommended Best Practices:

* Implement Individual User Accounts: Ensure each employee has their own unique login credentials to maintain accountability and security.
* Use a Reputable Password Manager: Securely store and manage passwords using trusted password management software.
* Create Strong, Unique Passwords: Ensure each account has a unique password that's difficult to guess.
* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts whenever possible.
* Regularly Update Passwords: Change passwords periodically and immediately if you suspect any compromise.
* Limit Access to Sensitive Information: Restrict the number of people who have access to critical systems and confidential data.

For more detailed information on secure password practices, please refer to reputable cybersecurity guidelines such as the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Password Guidelines](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/tig/back-basics-authentication) or the [Use Strong Passwords | CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/use-strong-passwords)

Your security is our top priority. By adopting these best practices, you help protect not only your own data but also contribute to the overall security of our shared network.
