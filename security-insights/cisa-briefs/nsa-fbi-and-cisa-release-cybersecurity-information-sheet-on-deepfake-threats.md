# NSA, FBI, and CISA Release Cybersecurity Information Sheet on Deepfake Threats

With the rise of AI and Machine learning the risk of DeepFakes is really increasing. What is a Deep Fake you might ask? It's where you use AI/ML to alter the image or video to be something it is not. Here is a Wikipedia article on deep fakes that explains a bit further what they are. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake)

We are constantly working with our security vendors, clients, and organizations like CISA to understand the risk's to both our clients and us.

Today, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI), [Contextualizing Deepfake Threats to Organizations](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.defense.gov%2F2023%2FSep%2F12%2F2003298925%2F-1%2F-1%2F0%2FCSI-DEEPFAKE-THREATS.PDF\&data=05%7C01%7Cwilliampote%40etoptechnology.com%7C9bc0a3295fd6430f8da808dbb3e3e2a4%7C65f1199e1fc04f91bd4fee3b7bae93b2%7C0%7C0%7C638301563608294652%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C\&sdata=n8ZdSSUt820iKcvQKfR%2BcF7bsO2j6t0syj3pu33Bvio%3D\&reserved=0), which provides an overview of synthetic media threats, techniques, and trends. Threats from synthetic media, such as deepfakes, have exponentially increased—presenting a growing challenge for users of modern technology and communications, including the National Security Systems (NSS), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and national critical infrastructure owners and operators. Between 2021 and 2022, U.S. Government agencies collaborated to establish a set of employable best practices to take in preparation and response to the growing threat. Public concern around synthetic media includes disinformation operations, designed to influence the public and spread false information about political, social, military, or economic issues to cause confusion, unrest, and uncertainty.

The authoring agencies urge organizations review [the CSI](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.defense.gov%2F2023%2FSep%2F12%2F2003298925%2F-1%2F-1%2F0%2FCSI-DEEPFAKE-THREATS.PDF\&data=05%7C01%7Cwilliampote%40etoptechnology.com%7C9bc0a3295fd6430f8da808dbb3e3e2a4%7C65f1199e1fc04f91bd4fee3b7bae93b2%7C0%7C0%7C638301563608294652%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C\&sdata=n8ZdSSUt820iKcvQKfR%2BcF7bsO2j6t0syj3pu33Bvio%3D\&reserved=0) for recommended steps and best practices to prepare, identify, defend against, and respond to deepfake threats.
