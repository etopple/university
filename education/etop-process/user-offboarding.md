**User Offboarding/Termination Guide**

Effectively managing the departure of an employee involves several key steps to ensure security and continuity within your Office 365 environment. Hereâ€™s a straightforward guide:

1. **Disable the User Account**:
   1. **Purpose**: This step prevents the departing employee from accessing their Office 365 account, securing your company's information.
   2. **Action**: We disable their account access, effectively revoking their ability to log in or use company resources.
2. **Remove Licensing**:
   1. **Purpose**: To avoid unnecessary costs by stopping the allocation of Office 365 services to the employee who no longer needs them.
   2. **Action**: The employee's license will be removed, ensuring you're only paying for the resources your team uses.
3. **Convert Mailbox to Shared**:
   1. **Purpose**: To keep the email communication accessible to the team after the employee leaves, without losing any important information.
   2. **Action**: We convert the individual mailbox into a shared one, assigning access to a manager or a selected coworker.
4. **Share/Move OneDrive Content**:
   1. **Purpose**: To ensure continuous access to important documents stored in the departing employeeâ€™s OneDrive.
   2. **Action**: The offboarding process will share a link to the files with a designated user at which point they can migrate them to themselves or let soft delete after 30 days.
5. **Disable Active Directory Account**:
   1. **Purpose**: This is a crucial step in maintaining network security by ensuring that the former employee can no longer access any part of your IT infrastructure.
   2. **Action**: We disable the employee's Active Directory account, which removes their access to all network resources and applications.
6. **User Deletion:**
   1. **Purpose:** User can be deleted from o365 and data will be retained for typically 30 days if restoration is needed
   2. **Action:** Awareness of the user deletion process - and Microsoft's native data retention policy

This structured approach to offboarding ensures that your company's data remains secure and accessible to authorized personnel. Should you need any assistance or have questions about this process, we're here to help.

**Attention: Important Update Regarding Mailboxes That Continue to Receive Email**

To enhance the security and management of mailboxes that need to remain active after an employee's departure, we are introducing a new policy:

* **Policy Detail**: Mailboxes that are required to keep receiving emails will be integrated into our **Email Security SKU**. This is to ensure that these mailboxes continue to benefit from our advanced security measures and management.
* **Small Upcharge**: There will be a **minimal monthly charge per retained mailbox**. This fee is to cover the additional security and management resources dedicated to these active mailboxes.
* **Reason for Charge**: The charge is necessary to maintain the high level of security and efficiency that our Email Security SKU offers. It helps in managing risks and ensuring that the mailboxes remain safe and functional.
* **How This Affects You**: If your offboarding process involves retaining mailboxes that continue to receive emails, please consider this additional cost in your planning. This policy ensures these mailboxes are secured and properly managed, contributing to the overall security of your organization's communication.
