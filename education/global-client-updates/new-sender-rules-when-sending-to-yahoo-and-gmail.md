# ðŸ“® New sender rules when sending to Yahoo and Gmail

If you frequently send email to your clients' personal Yahoo or GMail addresses, you are at greater risk for receiving a bounceback message.  You might wonder why this is suddenly an issue! After all, it worked last month.

Gmail and Yahoo have updated their poicies for businesses that send email to their users. Some of these eTop (or your IT provider) can assist with, but some will require some changes to your emails to make them more user friendly.

* Verify your email DNS changes are current and set up correctly - this is something eTop is doing for our clients proactively if you have given us access to your DNS. This includes Sender policy framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication (DMARC)
* If the message is a bulk email campaign, ensure that your bulk email service includes a simple, single-click "Unsubscribe" option
* Keep your messages from being reported as spam by sending out only relevant and valuable information to your audience.&#x20;
