# ðŸ›‘ Bad Patch Update

I hope this message finds you well. We wanted to bring to your attention a recent development concerning Microsoft updates KB5032189 and KB5033372. These updates have caused some unexpected issues, including Edge freezing, Outlook not loading, and anomalies in other Microsoft products.

At eTop Technology, we take the stability and performance of your IT environment seriously. In response to these challenges, we have initiated a proactive approach to mitigate any potential disruptions to your operations:

1. **Ad Hoc Rolling Back Updates:** Since this is not globally effecting our user base we are uninstalling those that are having issues and working with Microsoft and other Vendors to have a mitigating patch released.
2. **Blocking Updates Temporarily:** To prevent the recurrence of these issues, we are temporarily blocking the installation of KB5032189 and KB5033372 until Microsoft releases a stable update.

Please be assured that our team is working tirelessly to ensure that your IT infrastructure remains reliable and efficient. We understand that such disruptions can be frustrating, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We will keep you updated on our progress, and if you have any immediate concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team [welcome-to-working-with-etop](../etop-tools/welcome-to-working-with-etop/ "mention"). Your satisfaction and the smooth operation of your systems are our top priorities.

Thank you for your trust in eTop Technology as your IT Managed Service Provider. We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this situation promptly.
