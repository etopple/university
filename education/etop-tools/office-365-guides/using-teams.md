# ðŸ“… Using Teams

### Teams getting started

Microsoft 365 includes Teams in almost all licenses issued to our clients. &#x20;

You can access teams here [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com) or from the installed teams app on your PC. You will need to login with your Microsoft 365 username and password.&#x20;

### Teams Messaging

You should be added by your manager to the teams that your organization uses. In our case we have Several Teams (a group of people) with multiple channels under the team. The channel communications are very much an organized, collaborative effort and communications shouldn't be treated as a DM (direct message)&#x20;

**Teams and Channels**\
Create Teams and Channels to allow groups to work in virtual areas with conversations (or topics) and files.\
We highly recommend keeping individual issues or topics in a team channel -> topic so it becomes useable in the future. \
Note: Teams and channels are viewable by everyone in that group. Think of them as a collaboration with all members of the team/group/company.

**Direct Chats**\
Chat one on one or in groups about work, projects, the donuts in the breakroom, or just for fun. These chats are more casual - like an impromptu gathering while waiting for the coffee to brew.

### Video Meetings

Teams allows users to book meetings with others in the same organization or with clients/prospects. If you navigate to the Calendar button (teams integrates with your existing Outlook calendar) You can choose new meeting inside Teams and start/manage meetings!
