# 🆕 New Teams/Old Teams

Microsoft is rolling out a new version of Teams, aptly named "New Teams." If you see a button labeled "New Teams" within your Teams application, don't be alarmed - Teams isn't broken! Clicking this button will simply update your software to the latest version, bringing you new features and improvements.

We don’t recommend one over the other as they both still receive feature and security updates. At some point in the future Microsoft will remove Teams and move everyone over to “New Teams” – but for the foreseeable future they have a toggle in teams that lets you switch from Teams to New Teams and back!
