# ðŸ—“ Shared Calendars

Whether you manage a calendar for another person, or your office has a shared calendar for the conference room, you can access that calendar in Outlook. Here are two ways to access that calendar.

1. If you have an invitation to access a calendar in your inbox, open that and accept the invitation. That will open the calendar in your Outlook so you can see both.
2.  If access was granted in another way, open the Calendar Tab in Outlook or Outlook on the web.



    * **Outlook for Windows**:&#x20;
      1. In Calendar, click Home.
      2.  In the Manage Calendars group, click Add Calendar, and then click Open Shared Calendar.

          If you don't see Add Calendar, at the right end of the ribbon, select Add > Open Shared Calendar.
      3.  Type a name in the Name box, or click Name to select a name from the address book.

          The shared calendar appears next to any calendar that is already in the view.

          After you access a shared Calendar for the first time, the Calendar is added to the folder pane. The next time that you want to view the shared Calendar, you can click it in the Folder Pane.

          If the other person whose Calendar you want to open hasnâ€™t granted you permission to view it, Outlook prompts you to ask the person for permission. If you click Yes, a sharing request email message opens automatically. The message requests the person to share his or her Calendar with you and also provides the option to share your default Calendar with him or her.
