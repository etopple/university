# ü§ù Accessing Another Mailbox

Whether you are covering for another user while they're away or your organization has a shared mailbox to monitor and use, opening another mailbox in Outlook is common and a great way to stay updated with important information. Please note that the appropriate permissions need to be applied prior to accessing the mailbox.

In Outlook for desktop or mobile the instructions are slightly different. If the mailbox is mapped to your account it should happen automatically. These instructions are geared toward accessing the shared mailbox in Outlook on the web.

1. Sign into [https://outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com/) with your own account
2. In the top right corner, click your icon and select "Open another mailbox"\

4. The mailbox will open in a new tab. This will allow you to access the mailbox and easily switch back to your mailbox as well.\


**Important:** Full mailbox permissions do not by default grant the rights to send emails from the accounts granted permissions to view. If an email is sent from the shared mailbox, it will appear to be from your own email address. Please contact our helpdesk for assistance if you need to send emails on behalf of another account\
