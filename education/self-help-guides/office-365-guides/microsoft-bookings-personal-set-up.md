# ðŸ“† Microsoft Bookings - Personal Set up

Have you ever had this email thread happen?\
_"Let's meet soon!"_\
_"Yes, let's. How does Thursday look?"_\
_"Can't do Thursday; my guinea pig, Mighty Oinks, is competing in the local Cavy Olympics. How's next Tuesday?"_\
_"Tuesday works... let's say 11am?"_\
_"How about 11:30?"_\
.... and so on. Sending these emails back and forth is time consuming and frustrating. Microsoft has introduced a feature called Microsoft Bookings which provides a way to manage your scheduling without all the back and forth.

Before setting up Bookings, you will need a specific Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license. Most licenses managed by eTop Technology are supported - if you're not sure if yours is, feel free to [contact us.](../../etop-tools/welcome-to-working-with-etop/)

Once the licensing is in place, you can move on to configuring your own Personal booking page. \
Visit [https://outlook.office.com/bookings/homepage](https://outlook.office.com/bookings/homepage).&#x20;

You will be presented with a simple wizard welcoming you to the service. Click through to create your private booking page for you.

## **Public vs Private meeting types**

There are two kinds of meetings: public and private.&#x20;

Public meetings allow anyone to visit a page to select a meeting and schedule time on your calendar.&#x20;

Private meetings allow only people with a specific link to view the meeting and schedule time on your calendar.&#x20;

You can have a mix of public and private meetings associated with your personal bookings page.

### **Creating a new meeting type**&#x20;

1\. Click the plus sign next to either Public or Private type.\

In order for time to show up, it is important for time to be made available on the site.

### Sharing your booking page

The public meeting types appear on the booking page. You can share your new bookings page by clicking the Share icon at the top. Choose the option that works for you!\
