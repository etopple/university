# Public and Private Bookings

## **Public vs Private meeting types**

There are two kinds of meetings: public and private.&#x20;

Public meetings allow anyone to visit a page to select a meeting and schedule time on your calendar.&#x20;

Private meetings allow only people with a specific link to view the meeting and schedule time on your calendar.&#x20;

You can have a mix of public and private meetings associated with your personal bookings page.

### **Creating a new meeting type**&#x20;

In order for time to show up, it is important for time to be made available on the site.

### Sharing your booking page

#### Public meeting

The public meeting types appear on the booking page. You can share your new bookings page by clicking the Share icon at the top. You can add it to your email signature (check with your company's signature requirements), share it via email, or copy it to share in an email/site/or other communication.\

#### Private meeting type

Private meetings do not show up on the public bookings page. Private meetings can be shared in different ways:&#x20;

* Copy link - copies a link to the booking that is good for multiple people or multiple uses. This is great for one on ones, training, or appointments.&#x20;
* Copy single-use link - copies a link that is only good one time.&#x20;
* Share - can paste it in a document/website/email

We hope this guide has given ideas on how to use this valuable tool! Next we will show you how to book a meeting with a booking link that was shared with you!
