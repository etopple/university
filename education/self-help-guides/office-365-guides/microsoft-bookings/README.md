# ðŸ“† Microsoft Bookings

Have you ever had this email thread happen?\
_"Let's meet soon!"_\
_"Yes, let's. How does Thursday look?"_\
_"Can't do Thursday; my guinea pig, Mighty Oinks, is competing in the local Cavy Olympics. How's next Tuesday?"_\
_"Tuesday works... let's say 11am?"_\
_"How about 11:30?"_\
.... and so on. Sending these emails back and forth is time consuming and frustrating. Microsoft has introduced a feature called Microsoft Bookings which provides a way to manage your scheduling without all the back and forth.

Before setting up Bookings, you will need a specific Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license. Most licenses managed by eTop Technology are supported - if you're not sure if yours is, feel free to [contact us.](../../../welcome-to-working-with-etop/)
