# üîÅ SharePoint Sync

SharePoint is many things - but one of those things is a File and folder library you can access through OneDrive on your computer.&#x20;

In order to set this up, access the SharePoint library URL in your web browser. It will be something like: https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/folder/morestuff

Once there, click the Documents on the left, and Sync at the top.&#x20;

This adds the folder structure to your Windows File Explorer to work with it as you would any other folder and files.
