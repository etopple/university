# ‚òÅ OneDrive for Business

Microsoft's OneDrive for Business is included in Microsoft 365 licensing for most plans.&#x20;

It allows for simple but feature-rich cloud storage.

You can think of it as your own personal cloud, where you can keep your files safe and easily access them from any device with an internet connection.

So, instead of storing your important files only on one computer or a USB drive, you can put them in the OneDrive folder. This way, if something happens to your computer, or you want to work on your files from a different device, you can still reach into that folder and get everything you need.

And you don't have to worry about anyone else snooping around your folder either. It's secure, and only you can see and access the files in it, unless you choose to share them with specific people.

**There are multiple benefits for using OneDrive:**

1. You probably already have it. It is installed with Microsoft 365 desktop applications and will work with your Microsoft 365 account
2. Integration (part a) it is integrated with the Microsoft apps like Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint
3. Integration (part b) It is integrated with SharePoint and Teams and allows for easy sharing with granular permissions
4. Integration (part c) It is integrated with Microsoft Windows - you can access your files on demand right in the Windows File Explorer
