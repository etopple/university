# 📁 Known Folder Move

Known Folder Move is a feature of OneDrive that moves Desktop, Documents and Photos to OneDrive. This does change the path of any items that are stored in those directories, which means some shortcuts or references may need updated, but it provides extra peace of mind, knowing that you can retrieve deleted files.&#x20;
