# ü§ù File sharing with OneDrive

Within OneDrive, you have the ability to share who has access to your files. By default, the items stored in your OneDrive are only accessible by you. If you wish to share an item or folder with someone or a group of someones, you just need to adjust the sharing options!

You can access the sharing options in a few places, most common is the right click menu in File Explorer.&#x20;

Right click on a file or folder you'd like to share, and click Share\
![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png>)

That brings up a menu that looks like this:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In here you can send a notification to a contact about the files you shared, copy the link, or click the gear icon to change the settings - all optional of course.

Note: be careful with the "Anyone" access. Those are available to be accessed by anyone. It's smarter, and more  secure to limit to specific people, or your organization.
