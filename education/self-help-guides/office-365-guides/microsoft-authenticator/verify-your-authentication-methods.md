# üîê Verify your Authentication methods

There are multiple reasons your Authentication methods may need to change. Let's say you get a new phone and you need to set up Authenticator on it. Or you lost a device. Or maybe you are noticing some odd Authenticator behavior. Using a few clicks, you are able to review and edit your security information for your Microsoft 365 account.&#x20;

1. Log into your Microsoft account at [https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) using your email address and password.&#x20;
2.  From here you can\
    \- Change your sign-in default method\
    \- Add sign-in method\
    \- Change or delete your phone number\
    \- Change your password\
    \- Delete un-needed or inaccurate authentication methods\
