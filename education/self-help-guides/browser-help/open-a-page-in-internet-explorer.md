# ↗️ Open a page in Internet Explorer

If you access a site - Such as the California Electronic Adjudication Management System - that requires Internet Explorer Mode, you will likely need to set it up to always open in Internet Explorer mode. These settings expire every 30 days, so you will need to re-add them every month you need to access the site

Internet Explorer mode pages expire after 30 days. When they do, you will see a message indicating that the page will no longer load in Internet Explorer mode. Click "Add Back" in the prompts and that will allow you 30 more days in IE mode!\
