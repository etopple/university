# ðŸ’² QuickBooks Troubleshooting

QuickBooks, by Intuit, is commonly used accounting software. If you use it on a regular basis, you might be familiar with the following symptoms:

* QuickBooks requires an update
* QuickBooks does not launch
* Multiple errors when using QuickBooks

Here are some basic things **you** can do that resolve most QuickBooks issues. Only proceed with the next step if the performed step does not work:

1. Restart your computer. This gives QuickBooks the chance to close all open sessions and processes and start fresh. Chances are, this will also give QuickBooks the option to display any instructions needed for proper operation.
2. Start QuickBooks as an administrator. To do this, right-click on QuickBooks and select "Run as Administrator". If you're an eTop customer, this will trigger an [AutoElevate ](etop-tools/deployed-tools/autoelevate.md)workflow. This should prompt QuickBooks to install any needed critical updates.&#x20;
3. Update QuickBooks from the Help Menu. If QuickBooks launches, but you need further updates, click Help, Automatic Update, and Update Now. You might need to circle back to step 2 if needed.&#x20;
4. Run QuickBooks Tool Hub: [https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/login-password/fix-common-problems-errors-quickbooks-desktop-tool/L3Yab5gNN\_US\_en\_US](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/login-password/fix-common-problems-errors-quickbooks-desktop-tool/L3Yab5gNN\_US\_en\_US)
5. Search QuickBooks support site for the specific error and perform any listed steps.&#x20;
6. Contact Intuit support.&#x20;

As always, eTop is happy to help with any of the above steps should you need assistance. Create a [ticket ](../etop-tools/welcome-to-working-with-etop/helpdesk-buttons/)and we will be in touch!
