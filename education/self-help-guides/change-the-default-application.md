# ðŸ“ƒ Change the Default Application

When you receive a new PDF tool, get your prefered browser installed, or even have a new image editor, you may want to change your system to open those file types with the new software automatically. There are a number of ways to do this, but this guide will show you one of the easiest ways.

1. In Windows File Explorer or on the Desktop, locate a file that has the right file type: in this case PDF.\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)
2. Right-click and select "Properties"\
   &#x20;![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)
3. In the Properties Window, click "Change"\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)
4. In the popup that appears, select the application you wish to use and click "OK"\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)
5. Click "OK" or "Apply" then "OK" in the properties window, and the chosen application is now the default!\
