# Windows Server - Previous Versions

Did you know that most common cause of data loss is human error? It is common for people to make mistakes when moving, organizing, or editing a file structure.&#x20;

Our first line of defense is a feature of Windows called "Previous Versions." If your company has a file server, eTop has enabled Previous Versions.&#x20;

* To access this feature, right click in the folder, go to properties. \
  ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)
* Select the "Previous Version" tab\
  ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1).png>)
* Choose the date and time that the correct file or folder was last seen. \
  ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)
* If you need to restore an entire folder, double click into the folder version and select the folder, then click "Restore" to restore a copy of the file to the correct location. \

* If you need to restore a single file, click Open and locate the missing file. You can drag it back to where it should be and then close the "previous version" window. \
