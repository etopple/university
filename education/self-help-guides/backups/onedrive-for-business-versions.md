# OneDrive for Business Versions

Included with your Microsoft 365 subscription is OneDrive for Business. If your company allows for it, we have enabled OneDrive's Known Folder Move (or KFM) feature to back up your Desktop, Documents and Pictures to OneDrive for Business. You may also have saved other files to OneDrive.&#x20;

Similar to Previous Versions, you can use OneDrive for Business to recover files.&#x20;

Inside Windows File Explorer, right click on the file you need to restore the previous version. Select Version history\

A OneDrive menu will come up with a list of available previous versions.\

You can select the version desired, click the three dot menu, then Restore, download, or delete the version\

To restore items that were removed from OneDrive, you can review the OneDrive Recycle Bin.\
I generally right click on the folder in question in Windows File Explorer, then go to View Online. You could also visit [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com) and access OneDrive from there. \

Once in the Online OneDrive for Business portal, you can click on the Recycle Bin on the left hand folder. Much like the Recycle Bin in Windows, this is one spot for all your files that were deleted. Locate the file you need and restore it. The column on the right (blurred in this image) shows where the item will be when restored. \
