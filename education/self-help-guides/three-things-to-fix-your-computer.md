# üñ±Ô∏è Three things to fix your computer

If you're experiencing a computer issue, it's normal to feel apprehensive or concerned. After all, we use computers every day to accomplish work and personal tasks.&#x20;

But don't panic!

There are 3 things you can do. These things don't take any time and could be a quick fix to make sure you continue to be able to do what you need to do with the computer.

1. Restart your computer: it's a cliche for a reason. Restarting gives your computer a fresh start and starts all the different processes that get it to run correctly.
2. Check the connections: If your computer has a loose connection somewhere, it causes odd behavior. Simply disconnecting and reconnecting the items connected to your comptuer can fix this odd behavior.&#x20;
3. Clear your browser cache and cookies: If it's related to web issues such as slow loading times or errors, clearing your cache and cookies can help.
