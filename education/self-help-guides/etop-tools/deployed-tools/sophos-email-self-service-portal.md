1. **Release** = The email will be delivered to your email box, the next time an email from this sender arrives, itâ€™ll end up in quarantine.
2. **Release and Allow** = The email will be delivered to your email box, the next time an email from this sender arrives, itâ€™ll be delivered to your email box (not quarantined). (When you click this, the sender will be added to your Allow list).
3. **Delete** = The email will get deleted, the next time sender sends an email youâ€™ll see it in the quarantine
4. **Delete and Block** = The email will get deleted, the next time the sender sends an email itâ€™ll block by the system and wonâ€™t show in your quarantine. (When you click this, the sender will be added to your Allow/Block list, so if you change your mind you can allow it later on.)
