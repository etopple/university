# âŒš AutoElevate

AutoElevate allows you and your staff to perform tasks that would normally require Administrator access using a concept called Privileged Access Management.&#x20;

Privileged access management is crucial for maintaining a secure and controlled environment within the company. By leveraging PAM and tools like AutoElevate, we can effectively allow the applications that are approved, required, or necessary for your productivity while preventing the actions that are malicious, dangerous, or counterproductive.\
AutoElevate gives eTop the ability to save you time by reducing the need to open a ticket when software needs to be installed or updated.&#x20;

**How to use AutoElevate**

eTop has created a list of approved applications for your organization. Those applications should allow you to install them - without waiting for approval.&#x20;

In addition, when attempting to perform an elevated task - such as installing software - that has not on the pre-approved list, you can request approval in the moment - and a technician at eTop will review the request for security and need, and allow you to continue installing it.

**How it works:**

1. Run the needed task. In this example, we are trying to install some software needed to perform diagnostics. It will attempt to run, and when it finds it needs elevated privileges, it will verify with you that it is something that is needed.\

2. A message will come up with a 2 minute timer. We strive to react to each request within that time period during normal business hours. \

3. If the request was approved, you will see this message, with the option to run it right in the message:\
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (77).png>)\
   Click "OK" and the task should run with appropriate elevation. If it fails, you can attempt to complete the task manually.&#x20;
4. If the request was denied, you will see this message:\
