Mission statement: to keep technology from getting in the way of productivity. I have over fifteen years of experience helping people from all walks of life use the technology around us to help them do their jobs. Even with that many years' experience supporting Windows, Macintosh, and Mobile Devices, I still talk like a human being, not a robot. I highly value customer service and treating people with respect, no matter their level of experience. No question is too small and no project too complex for me. \
She also really owns making documentation functional and readable for both eTop Technology and clients!
